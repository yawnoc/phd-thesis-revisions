## Examiner~1 (A.B.) ##

1.
  """"{.examiner}
  If I were critical I would ask that the candidate
  extend both Section~1.1 and Chapter~9.
  [...]
  However I am not insistent that these modification[s] are made;
  they are certainly not a deal-breaker by any stretch.
  """"
  ----
  [NO] This was more of a remark rather than a hard suggestion.
  Indeed the examiner awarded a straight 'Pass'
  rather than a 'Pass subject to minor revision'.

  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  Suggest improvement to the explanation of Figure~3.22a.
  (Actual wording: it is a very "busy" diagram.)
  """"
  ----
  [YES] The following changes have been made to make the text terser
  and easier to understand:
  ----
  ====
  - Split the long 'frontiers of inflection' sentence using a semicolon.
  - Replaced ambiguous 'which' with explicit 'these frontiers'.
  - Removed reference to numerical integration, which is irrelevant.
  - Fixed missing hyphen for adjectival 'straight-line'.
  - Removed 'immediately' before 'discard'.
  - Replaced '{{x}}-axis' with '{{y}} = 0' and 'line of symmetry',
    both in the text and in the caption.
    ('{{x}}-axis' was confusing because Figure~3.22a has a frame, not axes.)
  ====
  ----
  [Page~40, Paragraph~4]:

  """"{.thesis}
  [...]
  Figure~3.22a shows (among other features) the frontiers of inflection

  which we obtain by computing</del>\
  <ins>; these frontiers are</ins> the zero-contours
  of the second derivative~(3.54)<del> using numerical integration</del>.
  [...]
  Since the end is to construct a domain
  with the straight<ins>-</ins>line contour {{x}} = π/2
  serving as the constant-temperature boundary,
  we <del>immediately</del> discard any convex portion of traced boundary
  which does not reach {{x}} = π/2. Of the remaining convex portions,
  those which do not reach <del>the {{x}}-axis ({{y}} = 0)</del>\
  <ins>{{y}} = 0 (the line of symmetry)</ins>
  are unable to join up with a convex portion
  from the opposite branch [...].

## Examiner~2 (I.M.) ##


### \h3-exam ###

++++++++++++++++{.revisions}
1.
  ----
  [Page~3, first top-level paragraph]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  where does ["as an ordinary differential equation~(ODE)
  for the traced boundaries, and integrate"] come from?
  """"
  ----
  [NO] This is just a broad statement of how boundary tracing works.
  ----

2.
  ----
  [Page~5, Figure~1.3]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  Of interesting note,
  this is also an important problem in porous media
  when pores are approximated as triangles.
  """"
  ----
  [NO] No revision to make; just a comment.
  ----

3.
  ----
  [Page~8, Paragraph~2]:
  ----
  """"{.thesis}
  [...] we must remember that the small-slope assumption ([[del]]{{T}})² ≪ 1
  does not hold <del>good</del><ins class="examiner">well</ins>
  in the highly nonlinear regimes of the Laplace--Young equation.
  """"
  ----
  [NO] Per Wiktionary b<https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hold_good>:
  ----
  """"
  ### Verb ###
  __hold good__ ([...]) (_intransitive_)
  ++++
  1. To continue being true or valid; to hold true.
  ++++
  """"

4.
  ----
  [Page~8, Paragraph~3]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  Can you put a diagram in showing and explaining
  [the Finn \&~Kosmodem'yanskii] modifications?
  """"
  ----
  [NO] A diagram *could* be put in,
  but it would not sit suitably within the context of the section
  because the Finn \&~Kosmodem'yanskii modifications
  are not boundary tracing modifications.
  ----

5.
  ----
  [Page~10]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  [...] Perhaps adding an example with figure
  of where boundary tracing was used to success might help.
  [...] A concrete example or further explanation of this
  would help set the stage for the importance of this work.
  """"
  ----
  [NO] Figure~1.7 and its related paragraph
  already do this (an example of prior boundary tracing).
  ----

6.
  ----
  [Page~14, unnumbered equation]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  ----
  [...] I suggest getting rid of the part before you introduce u(s) and v(s).
  At the very least reverse the order.
  You set everything up in terms of s already
  so deriving~(2.22) and~(2.23) is natural.
  You can then make a comment that if there are not any singularities
  then you could get u=u(v) (or vice versa) as du/ds/dv/ds.
  ----
  ----
  Actually, as I work it out, it's not immediately clear this calculus holds.
  ----
  """"
  ----
  [NO] The existing order of presentation is natural and logical.
  We begin with coordinate parametrisation (for analytical work)
  and only pass to arc-length~{{s}} (for numerical work)
  if there are singularities.
  Things are set up in terms of~{{s}} to avoid backtracking
  when presenting the arc-length case.
  ----
  ----
  The calculus (d{{v}}/d{{u}} = d{{v}}/d{{s}} ÷ d{{u}}/d{{s}}) is sound,
  as explained in the viva voce.
  ----

7.
  ----
  [Page~19, first paragraph]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  It doesn't hurt to remind the reader of the problem here
  so that they don't have to flip back and forth.
  """"
  ----
  [NO] The conduction--radiation problem is self-explanatory
  (conduction in the interior and radiation on the boundary),
  and I have used back references to earlier equations
  in order to keep the lead paragraph free of display equations
  (as I have consistently done for all chapters).
  ----

8.
  ----
  [Page~19, Figure~3.1]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  I would rewrite this section a bit by setting up the problem Txx=0
  with T=constant on x=a*lambda and radiation condition on x=lambda.
  It makes the problem and domain easier to visualize.
  You can then do your non-dimensionalization and explain that
  T=x is a solution and carry on.
  """"
  ----
  [NO] Since boundary tracing *starts with* solutions to the field equation
  (rather than ending with them),
  it is more appropriate to begin with the plane-source solution
  ({{T}} = {{h}}{0}{{x}}) from the outset.
  ----
  ----
  Furthermore, the suggested rewrite would raise questions such as
  why one of the boundaries isn't chosen at~{{x}} = 0;
  such issues are avoided in the existing presentation.
  ----

9.
  ----
  [Page~21, Paragraph~1, after~(3.15)]:
  ----
  """"{.thesis}
  [...] consists of the <del>infinite</del><ins class="examiner">finite</ins>
  strip 0 ≤ {{x}} ≤ 1.
  """"
  ----
  [NO] The strip is infinite in the {{y}}-direction.
  ----

10.
  ----
  [Page~21, Paragraph~2, before~(3.16)]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  avoid this kind of subjective language ["boring"] in the thesis :).
  """"
  ----
  [NO] The straight-line boundary ({{x}} = 1) is boring.
  This is no more subjective than saying that it is "trivial",
  but less highbrow.
  ----

11.
  ----
  [Page~21, equation~(3.16)]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  why not use the arclength formulation here. \|grad(T)=1\|.
  """"
  ----
  [NO] We want analytical results, and we can get them here
  by using coordinate (rather than arc-length) parametrisation.
  ----

12.
  ----
  [Page~34, equation~(3.53)]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  put x0 in here.
  """"
  ----
  [NO] Here we have:
  ----
  """"{.thesis}
  Algebraically, {{x}}{0} is the positive solution to [equation~(3.53)],
  a polynomial equation in~cos~{{x}}.
  """"
  ----
  Since (3.53)~is a generic equation, it ought to have {{x}} be generic,
  rather than substituted with the particular value~{{x}}{0}.
  Furthermore, keeping {{x}} generic is consistent with the treatment
  if the equation were to have two positive solutions, {{x}}{0} and~{{x}}{1}.
  ----

13.
  ----
  [Page~34, last line]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  do you want to draw
  [two curves which are virtually indistinguishable]
  together?
  """"
  ----
  [NO] The figure would simply appear as if there were only one curve.
  The caption would be no different to the existing text.
  ----

14.
  ----
  [Page~40, Paragraph~4]:
  ----
  """"{.thesis}
  [...] Only the portions of traced boundary
  which lie <ins class="examiner">on the</ins> convex side
  of the inflection frontiers
  will be valid as radiation boundaries. [...]
  """"
  ----
  [NO] Omitting "on the" is stylistic, in the same way that one might say
  "portions [...] which lie this side of the inflection frontiers".
  Having "on the" followed by "of the" is a bit of a mouthful.
  ----

15.
  ----
  [Page~40, Paragraph~4]:
  ----
  """"{.thesis}
  Since the <del>end</del><ins class="examiner">aim?</ins>
  is to construct a domain [...]
  """"
  ----
  [NO] End means aim.
  ----

16.
  ----
  [Page~40, Paragraph~5]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  [...]
  I'm not sure how to word it better because it is quite complex.
  Is it possible to add more figures to walk the reader through the steps?
  """"
  ----
  [NO]
  For improvements to the wording, see the changes made in reponse to
  [Examiner~1 \> Viva Voce \> Suggestion~1](#busy).
  ----

17.
  ----
  [Page~42, Paragraph~2]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  [Instead of "({{B}}~arbitrary)",] say what it is...\
  I know you say it in the figure but you should still say it here.
  """"
  ----
  [NO] The text has "the general case ({{B}}~arbitrary)".
  If the parenthetical were changed to "{{B}} = 0.082506",
  this would imply that "the general case" is that specific value,
  which it is not.
  ----

18.
  ----
  [Page~42, Paragraph~3]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  you need to be careful
  [when you say error is "strictly less than 7 × 10^−4"].
  This is not absolutely good.
  Is the error numerical or model?
  Does it refine with mesh size, etc.?
  """"
  ----
  [NO] The focus of boundary tracing is not numerics,
  so such a detailed analysis was not considered.
  The numerical verification only serves to ensure that
  nothing has gone awry with boundary tracing
  (which we know produces exact results when used correctly).
  ----

19.
  ----
  [Page~42, last line]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  ["completely"] is a strong word, I would remove it.
  It is very convincing yes, but there is no rigorous proof or anything.
  """"
  ----
  [YES] Compromise:
  ----
  """"{.thesis}
  We can therefore be <del>completely</del><ins>extremely</ins> confident
  in the validity of the boundary tracing procedure.
  """"
  ----
  See b<https://github.com/yawnoc/phd-thesis/commit/f1cde15>.
  ----

20.
  ----
  [Page~46, equation~(4.14)]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  This is a bit of a convoluted away to arrive at this.
  Since you're taking T0 and r0 as the scales anyway just do that
  and arrive at your dimensionless constant for the radiation condition.
  """"
  ----
  [NO] There was more than one way to choose the scales.
  Doing it in full shows why the chosen scaling is the best.
  ----

21.
  ----
  [Page~47, after~(4.21)]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  Just for math technicality,
  just because there is a maximum doesn't mean there is a single maximum.
  In fact x=1 is a critical point as well, but it is a minimum.
  Need just some different language here.
  """"
  ----
  [NO] I do not claim there is a single maximum because there is a maximum.
  The single maximum follows because there is a single sign change
  in the derivative from positive to negative.
  ----

22.
  ----
  [Page~52, first line]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  Is ["neither of these are limit cycles"] obvious? It's not clear to me.
  If it's just a repeat of the previous exercise
  then maybe state that doing this would show these are not limit cycles.
  """"
  ----
  [NO] Intuitively one would expect the limit cycles to disappear
  when {{A}} no longer takes the critical value.
  In any case, the sought exercise appears on the next page (Section~4.4.1).
  ----

23.
  ----
  [Page~52, Paragraph~3, first line]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  reword ["this restriction is most severe"]. Do you mean it's impossible?
  """"
  ----
  [NO] Not impossible, but hardly possible. At the end of that paragraph:
  ----
  """"{.thesis}
  [...] the only convex domain is the trivial disk
  whose boundary is the circle {{r}} = {{r}}{flat}.
  """"

24.
  ----
  [Page~52, Paragraph~3, middle]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  reword ["spiralling in forever towards the singularity"]
  """"
  ----
  [NO] The trajectory in question spirals in, forever, towards the singularity.
  ----

25.
  ----
  [Page~54, before~(4.36)]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  ----
  [For "tangent line to the circle",]
  you should clarify the tangent line to the circle at phi=0
  whichi s also the point of tangency for the curve.
  You should make this clear.
  ----
  ----
  [W]hat does ["up to a constant in~{{ϕ}}"] mean?
  ----
  """"
  ----
  [NO] "Up to a constant in~{{ϕ}}" means that
  we can add an arbitrary constant to~{{ϕ}} in~(4.36).
  Hence why there is no need to clarify that the tangency occurs at~{{ϕ}} = 0.
  Figure~4.7 (directly above) also makes it clear
  that the tangency occurs at~{{ϕ}} = 0.
  ----

26.
  ----
  [Page~54, equation~(4.37)]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  clarifying you're expanding phi small here.
  """"
  ----
  [NO] Obvious from the context.
  ----

27.
  ----
  [Page~54, unnumbered equation, after~(4.37)]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  ----
  I'm not sure I really get this.
  What does convexity at the point of tangency mean
  when locally it's quadratic?
  ----
  ----
  Also it looks like you're just limiting the incoming slope
  to be less than the circle.
  Why it this?
  ----
  """"
  ----
  [NO] {{ξ}} = 0 is the circle, not the tangent line,
  as explained in the viva voce.
  ----

28.{#acceleration}
  ----
  [Page~56, first line]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  [[[r]]''] isn't really acceleration...be careful with that terminology.
  """"
  ----
  [NO] We are parametrising, with {{r}} (the independent variable)
  playing the role of time.
  ----

29.
  ----
  [Page~56, Paragraph~1, after~(4.49)]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  does [{{κ}} have the same sign changes as the curvature]?
  Why not just use the curvature with the outward normal?
  """"
  ----
  [NO] Yes, {{κ}} has the same sign changes as the curvature.
  And we avoid the usual curvature because it contains a horrible power of~3/2.
  ----

30.
  ----
  [Page~56, Paragraph~2, before~(4.50)]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  is [{{L}} = log~{{r}}] really for brevity?
  Seems like more work.
  If need by just put (4.51) and then have L defined there.
  """"
  ----
  [NO] Yes it is for brevity. {{L}}~appears another 9~times.
  And having the definition separate from~(4.51) improves readability.
  ----

31.
  ----
  [Page~56, after~(4.54)]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  This analysis makes more mathematical sense than what you did above.
  Do you need the earlier piece [Page~54]?
  """"
  ----
  [NO] The earlier piece is needed.
  It makes sense to check that convexity is even possible,
  before we pass to a global curvature analysis.
  If convexity were not possible,
  then the global analysis would be a waste of time.
  ----

32.
  ----
  [Page~56, last paragraph, before numbered list]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  [Should {{r}} ≤ {{r}}{sharp} be] r=r\_sharp?
  """"
  ----
  [NO]
  {{r}} ≤ {{r}}{sharp} is (correctly) a disk.
  {{r}} = {{r}}{sharp} would be a circle.
  ----

33.
  ----
  [Page~58, Figure~4.12 and Paragraph~2]:
  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  It looks like the error is highest at the inner circle
  where the log condition is applied.
  Presumably a smaller inner radius will correct this.
  """"
  ----
  [NO] This is a misreading of Figure~4.12;
  note that the plotted relative error is negative.
  The relative error figure has now been made positive,
  per [Examiner~2 \> Viva Voce \> Suggestion~2](#absolute).

  ----
  """"{.examiner}
  how many [triangular elements] is it?
  State the exact value [instead of "some~400"].
  """"
  ----
  [NO] The main point of boundary tracing is not the numerics.
  The exact number is irrelevant.
  Even in numerics papers, inexact counts are given.

  [NO] This suggestion arose from a discussion about
  how good the numerical method (using Mathematica) was,

  Now, Part~I of the thesis applies boundary tracing to analytic solutions,
  producing *exact* results (in that we reduce the problem
  to integrating some ODEs, which can be done to any desired precision).
  The numerical work is simply there to *verify* those results;
  we are not pitting boundary tracing and numerics against each other.

  it should not be elevated by a comparison of what it can or cannot do
  compared to the {boundary tracing + verify error} approach.
