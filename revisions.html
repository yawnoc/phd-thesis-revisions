<h2>Examiner&nbsp;1 (A.B.)</h2>
<h3>Suggestions from Examiner's Report</h3>
<ol class="revisions">
<li><blockquote class="examiner">

However I am not insistent that these modification[s] are made;
they are certainly not a deal-breaker by any stretch.

<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> This was more of a remark rather than a hard suggestion.
Indeed the examiner awarded a straight 'Pass'
rather than a 'Pass subject to minor revision'.

</ol>
<h3>Suggestions from Viva Voce</h3>
<ol class="revisions">
<li id="busy"><p>
[Page 41]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
Suggest improvement to the explanation of Figure&nbsp;3.22a.
(Actual wording: it is a very "busy" diagram.)
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Adopted.</span> The following changes have been made to make the text terser
and easier to understand:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Split the long 'frontiers of inflection' sentence using a semicolon.
</li>
<li>Replaced ambiguous 'which' with explicit 'these frontiers'.
</li>
<li>Removed reference to numerical integration, which is irrelevant.
</li>
<li>Fixed missing hyphen for adjectival 'straight-line'.
</li>
<li>Removed 'immediately' before 'discard'.
</li>
<li>Replaced '<var>x</var>-axis' with '<var>y</var> = 0' and 'line of symmetry',
both in the text and in the caption.
('<var>x</var>-axis' was confusing because Figure&nbsp;3.22a has a frame, not axes.)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
[Page&nbsp;40, Paragraph&nbsp;4]:
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">
[…]
Figure&nbsp;3.22a shows (among other features) the frontiers of inflection
for the two branches of traced boundaries<del>,

[…]
Since the end is to construct a domain
with the straight<ins>-</ins>line contour <var>x</var> = π/2
serving as the constant-temperature boundary,
we <del>immediately</del> discard any convex portion of traced boundary
which does not reach <var>x</var> = π/2. Of the remaining convex portions,
those which do not reach <del>the <var>x</var>-axis (<var>y</var> = 0)</del><ins><var>y</var> = 0 (the line of symmetry)</ins>
are unable to join up with a convex portion
from the opposite branch […].

<h2>Examiner&nbsp;2 (I.M.)</h2>
<h3>Suggestions from Examiner's Report</h3>
<ol class="revisions">

</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
where does ["as an ordinary differential equation&nbsp;(ODE)

</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> This is just a broad statement of how boundary tracing works.

</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
Of interesting note,
this is also an important problem in porous media

<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> No revision to make; just a comment.

<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;8, Paragraph&nbsp;2]:
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">

does not hold <del>good</del><ins class="examiner">well</ins>
in the highly nonlinear regimes of the Laplace–Young equation.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Per Wiktionary &lt;<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hold_good">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hold_good</a>&gt;:
</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Verb</h3>

<ol>
<li>To continue being true or valid; to hold true.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;8, Paragraph&nbsp;3]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
Can you put a diagram in showing and explaining
[the Finn &amp;&nbsp;Kosmodem'yanskii] modifications?
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> A diagram <em>could</em> be put in,
but it would not sit suitably within the context of the section
because the Finn &amp;&nbsp;Kosmodem'yanskii modifications
are not boundary tracing modifications.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;10]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
[…] Perhaps adding an example with figure
of where boundary tracing was used to success might help.
[…] A concrete example or further explanation of this
would help set the stage for the importance of this work.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Figure&nbsp;1.7 and its related paragraph
already do this (an example of prior boundary tracing).
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;14, unnumbered equation]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
<p>
[…] I suggest getting rid of the part before you introduce u(s) and v(s).
At the very least reverse the order.
You set everything up in terms of s already
so deriving&nbsp;(2.22) and&nbsp;(2.23) is natural.
You can then make a comment that if there are not any singularities
then you could get u=u(v) (or vice versa) as du/ds/dv/ds.
</p>
<p>
Actually, as I work it out, it's not immediately clear this calculus holds.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The existing order of presentation is natural and logical.
We begin with coordinate parametrisation (for analytical work)
and only pass to arc-length&nbsp;<var>s</var> (for numerical work)
if there are singularities.
Things are set up in terms of&nbsp;<var>s</var> to avoid backtracking
when presenting the arc-length case.
</p>
<p>
The calculus (d<var>v</var>/d<var>u</var> = d<var>v</var>/d<var>s</var> ÷ d<var>u</var>/d<var>s</var>) is sound,
as explained in the viva voce.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;19, first paragraph]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
It doesn't hurt to remind the reader of the problem here
so that they don't have to flip back and forth.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The conduction–radiation problem is self-explanatory
(conduction in the interior and radiation on the boundary),
and I have used back references to earlier equations
in order to keep the lead paragraph free of display equations
(as I have consistently done for all chapters).
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;19, Figure&nbsp;3.1]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
I would rewrite this section a bit by setting up the problem Txx=0
with T=constant on x=a*lambda and radiation condition on x=lambda.
It makes the problem and domain easier to visualize.
You can then do your non-dimensionalization and explain that
T=x is a solution and carry on.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Since boundary tracing <em>starts with</em> solutions to the field equation
(rather than ending with them),
it is more appropriate to begin with the plane-source solution
(<var>T</var> = <var>h</var><sub>0</sub><var>x</var>) from the outset.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the suggested rewrite would raise questions such as
why one of the boundaries isn't chosen at&nbsp;<var>x</var> = 0;
such issues are avoided in the existing presentation.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;21, Paragraph&nbsp;1, after&nbsp;(3.15)]:
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">
[…] consists of the <del>infinite</del><ins class="examiner">finite</ins>
strip 0 ≤ <var>x</var> ≤ 1.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The strip is infinite in the <var>y</var>-direction.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;21, Paragraph&nbsp;2, before&nbsp;(3.16)]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
avoid this kind of subjective language ["boring"] in the thesis :).
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The straight-line boundary (<var>x</var> = 1) is boring.
This is no more subjective than saying that it is "trivial",
but less highbrow.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;21, equation&nbsp;(3.16)]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
why not use the arclength formulation here. |grad(T)=1|.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> We want analytical results, and we can get them here
by using coordinate (rather than arc-length) parametrisation.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;34, equation&nbsp;(3.53)]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
put x0 in here.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Here we have:
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">
Algebraically, <var>x</var><sub>0</sub> is the positive solution to [equation&nbsp;(3.53)],
a polynomial equation in&nbsp;cos&nbsp;<var>x</var>.
</blockquote>
<p>
Since (3.53)&nbsp;is a generic equation, it ought to have <var>x</var> be generic,
rather than substituted with the particular value&nbsp;<var>x</var><sub>0</sub>.
Furthermore, keeping <var>x</var> generic is consistent with the treatment
if the equation were to have two positive solutions, <var>x</var><sub>0</sub> and&nbsp;<var>x</var><sub>1</sub>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;34, last line]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
do you want to draw
[two curves which are virtually indistinguishable]
together?
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The figure would simply appear as if there were only one curve.
The caption would be no different to the existing text.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;40, Paragraph&nbsp;4]:
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">
[…] Only the portions of traced boundary
which lie <ins class="examiner">on the</ins> convex side
of the inflection frontiers
will be valid as radiation boundaries. […]
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Omitting "on the" is stylistic, in the same way that one might say
"portions […] which lie this side of the inflection frontiers".
Having "on the" followed by "of the" is a bit of a mouthful.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;40, Paragraph&nbsp;4]:
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">
Since the <del>end</del><ins class="examiner">aim?</ins>
is to construct a domain […]
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> End means aim.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;40, Paragraph&nbsp;5]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
[…]
I'm not sure how to word it better because it is quite complex.
Is it possible to add more figures to walk the reader through the steps?
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span>
For improvements to the wording, see the changes made in reponse to
<a href="#busy">Examiner&nbsp;1 &gt; Viva Voce &gt; Suggestion&nbsp;1</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;42, Paragraph&nbsp;2]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
[Instead of "(<var>B</var>&nbsp;arbitrary)",] say what it is…I know you say it in the figure but you should still say it here.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The text has "the general case (<var>B</var>&nbsp;arbitrary)".
If the parenthetical were changed to "<var>B</var> = 0.082506",
this would imply that "the general case" is that specific value,
which it is not.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;42, Paragraph&nbsp;3]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
you need to be careful
[when you say error is "strictly less than 7 × 10^−4"].
This is not absolutely good.
Is the error numerical or model?
Does it refine with mesh size, etc.?
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The focus of boundary tracing is not numerics,
so such a detailed analysis was not considered.
The numerical verification only serves to ensure that
nothing has gone awry with boundary tracing
(which we know produces exact results when used correctly).
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;42, last line]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
["completely"] is a strong word, I would remove it.
It is very convincing yes, but there is no rigorous proof or anything.

<p>
<span class="action">Adopted.</span> Compromise:
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">
We can therefore be <del>completely</del><ins>extremely</ins> confident
in the validity of the boundary tracing procedure.

</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;46, equation&nbsp;(4.14)]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
This is a bit of a convoluted away to arrive at this.
Since you're taking T0 and r0 as the scales anyway just do that
and arrive at your dimensionless constant for the radiation condition.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> There was more than one way to choose the scales.
Doing it in full shows why the chosen scaling is the best.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;47, after&nbsp;(4.21)]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
Just for math technicality,
just because there is a maximum doesn't mean there is a single maximum.
In fact x=1 is a critical point as well, but it is a minimum.
Need just some different language here.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> I do not claim there is a single maximum because there is a maximum.
The single maximum follows because there is a single sign change
in the derivative from positive to negative.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;52, first line]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
Is ["neither of these are limit cycles"] obvious? It's not clear to me.
If it's just a repeat of the previous exercise
then maybe state that doing this would show these are not limit cycles.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Intuitively one would expect the limit cycles to disappear
when <var>A</var> no longer takes the critical value.
In any case, the sought exercise appears on the next page (Section&nbsp;4.4.1).
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;52, Paragraph&nbsp;3, first line]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">

[W]hat does ["up to a constant in&nbsp;<var>ϕ</var>"] mean?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> "Up to a constant in&nbsp;<var>ϕ</var>" means that
we can add an arbitrary constant to&nbsp;<var>ϕ</var> in&nbsp;(4.36).
Hence why there is no need to clarify that the tangency occurs at&nbsp;<var>ϕ</var> = 0.
Figure&nbsp;4.7 (directly above) also makes it clear
that the tangency occurs at&nbsp;<var>ϕ</var> = 0.

</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Yes, <var>κ</var> has the same sign changes as the curvature.
And we avoid the usual curvature because it contains a horrible power of&nbsp;3/2.
</p>

<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;56, Paragraph&nbsp;2, before&nbsp;(4.50)]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">

<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Yes it is for brevity. <var>L</var>&nbsp;appears another 9&nbsp;times.

<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The earlier piece is needed.
It makes sense to check that convexity is even possible,
before we pass to a global curvature analysis.
If convexity were not possible,
then the global analysis would be a waste of time.

<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> This suggestion arose from a discussion about
how good the numerical method (using Mathematica) was,

Now, Part&nbsp;I of the thesis applies boundary tracing to analytic solutions,
producing <em>exact</em> results (in that we reduce the problem
to integrating some ODEs, which can be done to any desired precision).
The numerical work is simply there to <em>verify</em> those results;
we are not pitting boundary tracing and numerics against each other.
Since the numerical work plays only a supporting role,
it should not be elevated by a comparison of what it can or cannot do
compared to the {boundary tracing + verify error} approach.

Evidently the range of rounding radii
