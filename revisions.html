However I am not insistent that these modification[s] are made;

<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> This was more of a remark rather than a hard suggestion.
Indeed the examiner awarded a straight 'Pass'
rather than a 'Pass subject to minor revision'.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Other than the above remark,
the examiner only noted "a couple of trivial typographical errors",
but these were not raised at the viva voce.
Afterwards, I twice asked the Chair (M.R.) to request that
the examiner's list of minor corrections be sent through.
I do not understand why the list was not sent through,
and I note that I had no control over how the request for it was worded.

<h3>Suggestions from Viva Voce</h3>
<ol class="revisions">
<li id="busy"><blockquote class="examiner">
[Page 41]
Suggest improvement to the explanation of Figure&nbsp;3.22a.
(Actual wording: it is a very "busy" diagram.)
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Adopted.</span> The following changes have been made to make the text terser
and easier to understand:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Split the long 'frontiers of inflection' sentence using a semicolon.
</li>
<li>Replaced ambiguous 'which' with explicit 'these frontiers'.
</li>
<li>Removed reference to numerical integration, which is irrelevant.
</li>
<li>Fixed missing hyphen for adjectival 'straight-line'.
</li>
<li>Removed 'immediately' before 'discard'.
</li>
<li>Replaced '<var>x</var>-axis' with '<var>y</var> = 0' and 'line of symmetry',
both in the text and in the caption.
('<var>x</var>-axis' was confusing because Figure&nbsp;3.22a has a frame, not axes.)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
[Page&nbsp;40, Paragraph&nbsp;4]:

<li><blockquote class="examiner">
[Page&nbsp;8, Paragraph&nbsp;3]
Can you put a diagram in showing and explaining
[the Finn &amp;&nbsp;Kosmodem'yanskii] modifications?
</blockquote>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> A diagram <em>could</em> be put in,
but it would not sit suitably within the context of the section
because the Finn &amp;&nbsp;Kosmodem'yanskii modifications
are not boundary tracing modifications.
</li>
<li><blockquote class="examiner">
<p>
[Page&nbsp;14, unnumbered equation]
[…] I suggest getting rid of the part before you introduce u(s) and v(s).
At the very least reverse the order.
You set everything up in terms of s already
so deriving&nbsp;(2.22) and&nbsp;(2.23) is natural.
You can then make a comment that if there are not any singularities
then you could get u=u(v) (or vice versa) as du/ds/dv/ds.
</p>
<p>
Actually, as I work it out, it's not immediately clear this calculus holds.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The existing order of presentation is natural and logical.
We begin with coordinate parametrisation (for analytical work)
and only pass to arc-length&nbsp;<var>s</var> (for numerical work)
if there are singularities.
Things are set up in terms of&nbsp;<var>s</var> to avoid backtracking
when presenting the arc-length case.
</p>
<p>
The calculus (d<var>v</var>/d<var>u</var> = d<var>v</var>/d<var>s</var> ÷ d<var>u</var>/d<var>s</var>) is sound,
as explained in the viva voce.
</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote class="examiner">
[Page&nbsp;19, Figure&nbsp;3.1]
I would rewrite this section a bit by setting up the problem Txx=0
with T=constant on x=a*lambda and radiation condition on x=lambda.
It makes the problem and domain easier to visualize.
You can then do your non-dimensionalization and explain that
T=x is a solution and carry on.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Since boundary tracing <em>starts with</em> solutions to the field equation
(rather than ending with them),
it is more appropriate to begin with the plane-source solution
(<var>T</var> = <var>h</var><sub>0</sub><var>x</var>) from the outset.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the suggested rewrite would raise questions such as
why one of the boundaries isn't chosen at&nbsp;<var>x</var> = 0;
such issues are avoided in the existing presentation.

<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The strip is infinite in the <var>y</var>-direction.

</li>
<li><blockquote class="examiner">
[Page&nbsp;21, Paragraph&nbsp;2, before&nbsp;(3.16)]
avoid this kind of subjective language ["boring"] in the thesis :).
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The straight-line boundary (<var>x</var> = 1) is boring.
This is no more subjective than saying that it is "trivial",
but less highbrow.
</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote class="examiner">
[Page&nbsp;21, equation&nbsp;(3.16)]
why not use the arclength formulation here. |grad(T)=1|.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> We want analytical results, and we can get them here
by using coordinate (rather than arc-length) parametrisation.
</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote class="examiner">
[Page&nbsp;34, equation&nbsp;(3.53)]
put x0 in here.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Here we have:
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">
Algebraically, <var>x</var><sub>0</sub> is the positive solution to [equation&nbsp;(3.53)],
a polynomial equation in&nbsp;cos&nbsp;<var>x</var>.
</blockquote>
<p>
Since (3.53)&nbsp;is a generic equation, it ought to have <var>x</var> be generic,
rather than substituted with the particular value&nbsp;<var>x</var><sub>0</sub>.
Furthermore, keeping <var>x</var> generic is consistent with the treatment
if the equation were to have two positive solutions, <var>x</var><sub>0</sub> and&nbsp;<var>x</var><sub>1</sub>.
</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote class="examiner">
[Page&nbsp;34, last line]
do you want to draw
[two curves which are virtually indistinguishable]

<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The figure would simply appear as if there were only one curve.
The caption would be no different to the existing text.

<li>[Page&nbsp;40, Paragraph&nbsp;4]:
<blockquote class="thesis">
[…] Only the portions of traced boundary
which lie <ins class="examiner">on the</ins> convex side
of the inflection frontiers
will be valid as radiation boundaries. […]
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Omitting "on the" is stylistic, in the same way that one might say
"portions […] which lie this side of the inflection frontiers".
Having "on the" followed by "of the" is a bit of a mouthful.
</p>
</li>
<li>[Page&nbsp;40, Paragraph&nbsp;4]:
<blockquote class="thesis">
Since the <del>end</del><ins class="examiner">aim?</ins>

<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The text has "the general case (<var>B</var>&nbsp;arbitrary)".
If the parenthetical were changed to "<var>B</var> = 0.082506",
this would imply that "the general case" is that specific value,
which it is not.

This is a bit of a convoluted away to arrive at this.
Since you're taking T0 and r0 as the scales anyway just do that

</blockquote>
<p>

Doing it in full shows why the chosen scaling is the best.
</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote class="examiner">

Just for math technicality,
just because there is a maximum doesn't mean there is a single maximum.
In fact x=1 is a critical point as well, but it is a minimum.
Need just some different language here.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> I do not claim there is a single maximum because there is a maximum.
The single maximum follows because the sign change is the only sign change.

Is ["neither of these are limit cycles"] obvious? It's not clear to me.

<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Intuitively one would expect the limit cycles to disappear

<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> "Up to a constant in&nbsp;<var>ϕ</var>" means that
we can add an arbitrary constant to&nbsp;<var>ϕ</var> in&nbsp;(4.36).
Hence why there is no need to clarify that the tangency occurs at&nbsp;<var>ϕ</var> = 0.

For general equations I have consistently used radians,
(e.g. for regime inequalities such as <var>α</var> &lt; π/2 − <var>γ</var>).
In specific numerical examples I have used degrees for readability.
For example, if (<var>α</var>, <var>γ</var>) = (40°, 55°) then we can immediately see
that it belongs to the moderate regime
(because the angles add to more than 90°).
This is far from obvious if we instead write (<var>α</var>, <var>γ</var>) = (2π/9, 11π/36).

Suggest remark about Mathematica not being able to
readily handle self-viewing (non-local) boundary conditions,
so the approach of verifying that self-viewing radiation is small
after boundary tracing is a powerful one.
(Actual wording: it was a "checkmark" for boundary tracing.)
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> This suggestion arose from a discussion about
how good the numerical method (using Mathematica) was,
and whether I could have done an extra example for a self-viewing case.
Now, Part&nbsp;I of the thesis applies boundary tracing to analytic solutions,
producing <em>exact</em> results (in that we reduce the problem
to integrating some ODEs, which can be done to any desired precision).
The numerical work is simply there to <em>verify</em> those results;
we are not pitting boundary tracing and numerics against each other.
Since the numerical work plays only a supporting role,
it should not be elevated by a comparison of what it can or cannot do
compared to the {boundary tracing + verify error} approach.

Evidently the range of rounding radii
which can be accounted for in this manner [boundary tracing]
is directly related to the spread of the corner roundings,
over which we have no control.
The main weakness of boundary tracing is that
one cannot predetermine the shape of the resulting traced boundaries,
but this is to be expected for a method where, by its very nature,
boundary shape is the unknown.
