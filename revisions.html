<h3>Suggestions from Examiner's Report</h3>
<ol class="revisions">
<li><blockquote class="examiner">

However I am not insistent that these modification[s] are made;
they are certainly not a deal-breaker by any stretch.

<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> This was more of a remark rather than a hard suggestion.
Indeed the examiner awarded a straight 'Pass'
rather than a 'Pass subject to minor revision'.

<h3>Suggestions from Viva Voce</h3>
<ol class="revisions">
<li id="busy"><p>
[Page 41]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
Suggest improvement to the explanation of Figure&nbsp;3.22a.
(Actual wording: it is a very "busy" diagram.)
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Adopted.</span> The following changes have been made to make the text terser
and easier to understand:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Split the long 'frontiers of inflection' sentence using a semicolon.
</li>
<li>Replaced ambiguous 'which' with explicit 'these frontiers'.
</li>
<li>Removed reference to numerical integration, which is irrelevant.
</li>
<li>Fixed missing hyphen for adjectival 'straight-line'.
</li>
<li>Removed 'immediately' before 'discard'.
</li>
<li>Replaced '<var>x</var>-axis' with '<var>y</var> = 0' and 'line of symmetry',
both in the text and in the caption.
('<var>x</var>-axis' was confusing because Figure&nbsp;3.22a has a frame, not axes.)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
[Page&nbsp;40, Paragraph&nbsp;4]:
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">
[…]
Figure&nbsp;3.22a shows (among other features) the frontiers of inflection

[…]
Since the end is to construct a domain

serving as the constant-temperature boundary,
we <del>immediately</del> discard any convex portion of traced boundary

those which do not reach <del>the <var>x</var>-axis (<var>y</var> = 0)</del><ins><var>y</var> = 0 (the line of symmetry)</ins>

<h2>Examiner&nbsp;2 (I.M.)</h2>
<h3>Suggestions from Examiner's Report</h3>
<ol class="revisions">

</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
where does ["as an ordinary differential equation&nbsp;(ODE)

</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> This is just a broad statement of how boundary tracing works.

</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
Of interesting note,
this is also an important problem in porous media

<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> No revision to make; just a comment.

<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;8, Paragraph&nbsp;2]:
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">

does not hold <del>good</del><ins class="examiner">well</ins>
in the highly nonlinear regimes of the Laplace–Young equation.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Per Wiktionary &lt;<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hold_good">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hold_good</a>&gt;:
</p>

<h3>Verb</h3>

<ol>
<li>To continue being true or valid; to hold true.

</ol>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;8, Paragraph&nbsp;3]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
Can you put a diagram in showing and explaining
[the Finn &amp;&nbsp;Kosmodem'yanskii] modifications?
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> A diagram <em>could</em> be put in,
but it would not sit suitably within the context of the section
because the Finn &amp;&nbsp;Kosmodem'yanskii modifications
are not boundary tracing modifications.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;10]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
[…] Perhaps adding an example with figure
of where boundary tracing was used to success might help.
[…] A concrete example or further explanation of this
would help set the stage for the importance of this work.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Figure&nbsp;1.7 and its related paragraph
already do this (an example of prior boundary tracing).
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;14, unnumbered equation]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
<p>
[…] I suggest getting rid of the part before you introduce u(s) and v(s).
At the very least reverse the order.
You set everything up in terms of s already
so deriving&nbsp;(2.22) and&nbsp;(2.23) is natural.
You can then make a comment that if there are not any singularities
then you could get u=u(v) (or vice versa) as du/ds/dv/ds.
</p>
<p>
Actually, as I work it out, it's not immediately clear this calculus holds.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The existing order of presentation is natural and logical.
We begin with coordinate parametrisation (for analytical work)
and only pass to arc-length&nbsp;<var>s</var> (for numerical work)
if there are singularities.
Things are set up in terms of&nbsp;<var>s</var> to avoid backtracking
when presenting the arc-length case.
</p>
<p>
The calculus (d<var>v</var>/d<var>u</var> = d<var>v</var>/d<var>s</var> ÷ d<var>u</var>/d<var>s</var>) is sound,
as explained in the viva voce.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;19, first paragraph]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
It doesn't hurt to remind the reader of the problem here
so that they don't have to flip back and forth.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The conduction–radiation problem is self-explanatory
(conduction in the interior and radiation on the boundary),
and I have used back references to earlier equations
in order to keep the lead paragraph free of display equations
(as I have consistently done for all chapters).
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;19, Figure&nbsp;3.1]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
I would rewrite this section a bit by setting up the problem Txx=0
with T=constant on x=a*lambda and radiation condition on x=lambda.
It makes the problem and domain easier to visualize.
You can then do your non-dimensionalization and explain that
T=x is a solution and carry on.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Since boundary tracing <em>starts with</em> solutions to the field equation
(rather than ending with them),
it is more appropriate to begin with the plane-source solution
(<var>T</var> = <var>h</var><sub>0</sub><var>x</var>) from the outset.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the suggested rewrite would raise questions such as
why one of the boundaries isn't chosen at&nbsp;<var>x</var> = 0;
such issues are avoided in the existing presentation.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;21, Paragraph&nbsp;1, after&nbsp;(3.15)]:
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">
[…] consists of the <del>infinite</del><ins class="examiner">finite</ins>
strip 0 ≤ <var>x</var> ≤ 1.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The strip is infinite in the <var>y</var>-direction.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;21, Paragraph&nbsp;2, before&nbsp;(3.16)]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
avoid this kind of subjective language ["boring"] in the thesis :).
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The straight-line boundary (<var>x</var> = 1) is boring.
This is no more subjective than saying that it is trivial,
but less highbrow.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;21, equation&nbsp;(3.16)]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
why not use the arclength formulation here. |grad(T)=1|.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> We want analytical results, and we can get them here
by using coordinate (rather than arc-length) parametrisation.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;34, equation&nbsp;(3.53)]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
put x0 in here.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Here we have:
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">
Algebraically, <var>x</var><sub>0</sub> is the positive solution to [equation&nbsp;(3.53)],
a polynomial equation in&nbsp;cos&nbsp;<var>x</var>.
</blockquote>
<p>
Since (3.53)&nbsp;is a generic equation, it ought to have <var>x</var> generic,
rather than substituted with the particular value&nbsp;<var>x</var><sub>0</sub>.
Furthermore, keeping <var>x</var> generic is consistent with the treatment
if the equation were to have two positive solutions, <var>x</var><sub>0</sub> and&nbsp;<var>x</var><sub>1</sub>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;34, last line]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
do you want to draw
[two curves which are virtually indistinguishable]
together?
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The figure would simply appear as if there were only one curve.
The caption would be no different to the existing text.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;40, Paragraph&nbsp;4]:
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">
[…] Only the portions of traced boundary
which lie <ins class="examiner">on the</ins> convex side
of the inflection frontiers
will be valid as radiation boundaries. […]
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Omitting "on the" is stylistic, in the same way that one might say
"portions […] which lie this side of the inflection frontiers".
Having "on the" followed by "of the" is a bit of a mouthful.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;40, Paragraph&nbsp;4]:
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">
Since the <del>end</del><ins class="examiner">aim?</ins>
is to construct a domain […]
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> End means aim.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;40, Paragraph&nbsp;5]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
[…]
I'm not sure how to word it better because it is quite complex.
Is it possible to add more figures to walk the reader through the steps?
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span>
For improvements to the wording, see the changes made in response to
<a href="#busy">Examiner&nbsp;1 &gt; Viva Voce &gt; Suggestion&nbsp;1</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;42, Paragraph&nbsp;2]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
[Instead of "(<var>B</var>&nbsp;arbitrary)",] say what it is…I know you say it in the figure but you should still say it here.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The text has "the general case (<var>B</var>&nbsp;arbitrary)".
If the parenthetical were changed to "<var>B</var> = 0.082506",
this would imply that "the general case" is that specific value,
which it is not.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;42, Paragraph&nbsp;3]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
you need to be careful
[when you say error is "strictly less than 7 × 10^−4"].
This is not absolutely good.
Is the error numerical or model?
Does it refine with mesh size, etc.?
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The focus of boundary tracing is not numerics,
so such a detailed analysis was not considered.
The numerical verification only serves to ensure that
nothing has gone awry with boundary tracing
(which we know produces exact results when used correctly).
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;42, last line]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
["completely"] is a strong word, I would remove it.
It is very convincing yes, but there is no rigorous proof or anything.

<p>
<span class="action">Adopted.</span> Compromise:

<blockquote class="thesis">
We can therefore be <del>completely</del><ins>extremely</ins> confident
in the validity of the boundary tracing procedure.

</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;46, equation&nbsp;(4.14)]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
This is a bit of a convoluted away to arrive at this.
Since you're taking T0 and r0 as the scales anyway just do that
and arrive at your dimensionless constant for the radiation condition.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> There is more than one way to choose the scales.
Doing it in full shows why the chosen scaling is the best.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;47, after&nbsp;(4.21)]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
Just for math technicality,
just because there is a maximum doesn't mean there is a single maximum.
In fact x=1 is a critical point as well, but it is a minimum.
Need just some different language here.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> I do not claim there is a single maximum because there is a maximum.
The single maximum follows because there is a single sign change
in the derivative from positive to negative.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
[Page&nbsp;52, first line]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
Is ["neither of these are limit cycles"] obvious? It's not clear to me.
If it's just a repeat of the previous exercise
then maybe state that doing this would show these are not limit cycles.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Intuitively one would expect the limit cycles to disappear
when <var>A</var> no longer takes the critical value.
In any case, the sought exercise appears on the next page (Section&nbsp;4.4.1).
</p>
</li>
<li id="most-severe"><p>
[Page&nbsp;52, Paragraph&nbsp;3, first line]:

<blockquote class="examiner">

Most means very.
At the end of that paragraph:

<blockquote class="thesis">

You should make this clear.

[W]hat does ["up to a constant in&nbsp;<var>ϕ</var>"] mean?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> "Up to a constant in&nbsp;<var>ϕ</var>" means that
we can add an arbitrary constant to&nbsp;<var>ϕ</var> in&nbsp;(4.36).
Hence why there is no need to clarify that the tangency occurs at&nbsp;<var>ϕ</var> = 0.
Figure&nbsp;4.7 (directly above) also makes it clear
that the tangency occurs at&nbsp;<var>ϕ</var> = 0.

<blockquote class="examiner">

</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Yes, <var>κ</var> has the same sign changes as the curvature.
We avoid the usual curvature because it contains an extra factor
with a horrible power of&nbsp;3/2.
</p>

[Page&nbsp;56, Paragraph&nbsp;2, before&nbsp;(4.50)]:
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">

<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Yes it is for brevity. <var>L</var>&nbsp;appears another 9&nbsp;times.
And having the definition separate from&nbsp;(4.51) improves readability.

<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The earlier piece is needed.
It makes sense to check that convexity is even possible,
before we pass to a global curvature analysis.
If convexity were not possible,
then the global analysis would be a waste of time.

given an already-computed numerical solution to a boundary value problem,
we may as well apply boundary tracing to it.

Suggest remark about Mathematica not being able to
readily handle self-viewing (non-local) boundary conditions,
so the approach of verifying that self-viewing radiation is small
after boundary tracing is a powerful one.
(Actual wording: it was a "checkmark" for boundary tracing.)
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> This suggestion arose from a discussion about
how good the numerical method (using Mathematica) was,
and whether I could have done an extra example for a self-viewing case.
Now, Part&nbsp;I of the thesis applies boundary tracing to analytic solutions,
producing <em>exact</em> results (in that we reduce the problem
to integrating some ODEs, which can be done to any desired precision).
The numerical work is simply there to <em>verify</em> those results;
we are not pitting boundary tracing and numerics against each other.
Since the numerical work plays only a supporting role,
it should not be elevated by a comparison of what it can or cannot do
compared to the {boundary tracing + verify error} approach.

</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">

Evidently the range of rounding radii
which can be accounted for in this manner [boundary tracing]
is directly related to the spread of the corner roundings,
over which we have no control.
The main weakness of boundary tracing is that
one cannot predetermine the shape of the resulting traced boundaries,
but this is to be expected for a method where, by its very nature,
boundary shape is the unknown.
