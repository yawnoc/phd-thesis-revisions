<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> This was more of a remark rather than a hard suggestion.
Indeed the examiner awarded a straight 'Pass'
rather than a 'Pass subject to minor revision'.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Other than the above remark,
the examiner only noted "a couple of trivial typographical errors",
but these were not raised at the viva voce.
Afterwards, I twice asked the Chair (M.R.) to request that
the examiner's list of minor corrections be sent through.
I do not understand why the list was not sent through,
and I note that I had no control over how the request for it was worded.

Suggest improvement to the explanation of Figure&nbsp;3.22a.

<p>
<span class="action">Adopted.</span> The following changes have been made to make the text terser
and easier to understand:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Split the long 'frontiers of inflection' sentence using a semicolon.
</li>
<li>Replaced ambiguous 'which' with explicit 'these frontiers'.
</li>
<li>Removed reference to numerical integration, which is irrelevant.
</li>
<li>Fixed missing hyphen for adjectival 'straight-line'.

<li>Removed 'immediately' before 'discard'.
</li>
<li>Replaced '<var>x</var>-axis' with '<var>y</var> = 0' and 'line of symmetry',
both in the text and in the caption.
('<var>x</var>-axis' was confusing because Figure&nbsp;3.22a has a frame, not axes.)

Can you put a diagram in showing and explaining
[the Finn &amp;&nbsp;Kosmodem'yanskii] modifications?
</blockquote>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> A diagram <em>could</em> be put in,

[Page&nbsp;14, unnumbered equation]
[…] I suggest getting rid of the part before you introduce u(s) and v(s).
At the very least reverse the order.
You set everything up in terms of s already
so deriving&nbsp;(2.22) and&nbsp;(2.23) is natural.
You can then make a comment that if there are not any singularities
then you could get u=u(v) (or vice versa) as du/ds/dv/ds.
</p>
<p>
Actually, as I work it out, it's not immediately clear this calculus holds.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The existing order of presentation is natural and logical.
We begin with coordinate parametrisation (for analytical work)
and only pass to arc-length&nbsp;<var>s</var> (for numerical work)
if there are singularities.
Things are set up in terms of&nbsp;<var>s</var> to avoid backtracking
when presenting the arc-length case.
</p>
<p>
The calculus (d<var>v</var>/d<var>u</var> = d<var>v</var>/d<var>s</var> ÷ d<var>u</var>/d<var>s</var>) is sound,
as explained in the viva voce.

<li><blockquote class="examiner">
[Page&nbsp;19, Figure&nbsp;3.1]
I would rewrite this section a bit by setting up the problem Txx=0
with T=constant on x=a*lambda and radiation condition on x=lambda.
It makes the problem and domain easier to visualize.
You can then do your non-dimensionalization and explain that
T=x is a solution and carry on.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Since boundary tracing <em>starts with</em> solutions to the field equation
(rather than ending with them),
it is more appropriate to begin with the plane-source solution
(<var>T</var> = <var>h</var><sub>0</sub><var>x</var>) from the outset.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the suggested rewrite would raise questions such as
why one of the boundaries isn't chosen at&nbsp;<var>x</var> = 0;
such issues are avoided in the existing presentation.

Algebraically, <var>x</var><sub>0</sub> is the positive solution to [equation&nbsp;(3.53)],
a polynomial equation in&nbsp;cos&nbsp;<var>x</var>.
</blockquote>
<p>
Since (3.53)&nbsp;is a generic equation, it ought to have <var>x</var> be generic,
rather than substituted with the particular value&nbsp;<var>x</var><sub>0</sub>.
Furthermore, keeping <var>x</var> generic is consistent with the treatment

<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Omitting "on the" is stylistic, in the same way that one might say
"portions […] which lie this side of the inflection frontiers".

Suggest remark about Mathematica not being able to
readily handle self-viewing (non-local) boundary conditions,
so the approach of verifying that self-viewing radiation is small
after boundary tracing is a powerful one.
(Actual wording: it was a "checkmark" for boundary tracing.)
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> This suggestion arose from a discussion about
how good the numerical method (using Mathematica) was,
and whether I could have done an extra example for a self-viewing case.
Now, Part&nbsp;I of the thesis applies boundary tracing to analytic solutions,
producing <em>exact</em> results (in that we reduce the problem
to integrating some ODEs, which can be done to any desired precision).
The numerical work is simply there to <em>verify</em> those results;
we are not pitting boundary tracing and numerics against each other.
Since the numerical work plays only a supporting role,
it should not be elevated by a comparison of what it can or cannot do
compared to the {boundary tracing + verify error} approach.

Evidently the range of rounding radii

over which we have no control.
The main weakness of boundary tracing is that
one cannot predetermine the shape of the resulting traced boundaries,

boundary shape is the unknown.
