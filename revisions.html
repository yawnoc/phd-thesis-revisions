<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> This was more of a remark rather than a hard suggestion.
Indeed the examiner awarded a straight 'Pass'
rather than a 'Pass subject to minor revision'.

<p>
Other than the above remark,
the examiner only noted "a couple of trivial typographical errors",
but these were not raised at the viva voce.
Afterwards, I twice asked the Chair (M.R.) to request that
the examiner's list of minor corrections be sent through.
I do not understand why the list was not sent through,
and I note that I had no control over how the request for it was worded.

Suggest improvement to the explanation of Figure&nbsp;3.22a.

<p>
<span class="action">Adopted.</span> The following changes have been made to make the text terser
and easier to understand:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Split the long 'frontiers of inflection' sentence using a semicolon.
</li>
<li>Replaced ambiguous 'which' with explicit 'these frontiers'.
</li>
<li>Removed reference to numerical integration, which is irrelevant.
</li>
<li>Fixed missing hyphen for adjectival 'straight-line'.

<li>Removed 'immediately' before 'discard'.
</li>
<li>Replaced '<var>x</var>-axis' with '<var>y</var> = 0' and 'line of symmetry',
both in the text and in the caption.
('<var>x</var>-axis' was confusing because Figure&nbsp;3.22a has a frame, not axes.)

Can you put a diagram in showing and explaining
[the Finn &amp;&nbsp;Kosmodem'yanskii] modifications?

<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> A diagram <em>could</em> be put in,

[Page&nbsp;14, unnumbered equation]
[…] I suggest getting rid of the part before you introduce u(s) and v(s).
At the very least reverse the order.
You set everything up in terms of s already
so deriving&nbsp;(2.22) and&nbsp;(2.23) is natural.
You can then make a comment that if there are not any singularities
then you could get u=u(v) (or vice versa) as du/ds/dv/ds.
</p>
<p>
Actually, as I work it out, it's not immediately clear this calculus holds.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The existing order of presentation is natural and logical.
We begin with coordinate parametrisation (for analytical work)
and only pass to arc-length&nbsp;<var>s</var> (for numerical work)
if there are singularities.
Things are set up in terms of&nbsp;<var>s</var> to avoid backtracking
when presenting the arc-length case.
</p>
<p>
The calculus (d<var>v</var>/d<var>u</var> = d<var>v</var>/d<var>s</var> ÷ d<var>u</var>/d<var>s</var>) is sound,
as explained in the viva voce.

<li><blockquote class="examiner">
[Page&nbsp;19, Figure&nbsp;3.1]
I would rewrite this section a bit by setting up the problem Txx=0
with T=constant on x=a*lambda and radiation condition on x=lambda.
It makes the problem and domain easier to visualize.
You can then do your non-dimensionalization and explain that
T=x is a solution and carry on.
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Since boundary tracing <em>starts with</em> solutions to the field equation
(rather than ending with them),
it is more appropriate to begin with the plane-source solution
(<var>T</var> = <var>h</var><sub>0</sub><var>x</var>) from the outset.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the suggested rewrite would raise questions such as
why one of the boundaries isn't chosen at&nbsp;<var>x</var> = 0;
such issues are avoided in the existing presentation.

<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> The straight-line boundary (<var>x</var> = 1) is boring.

Algebraically, <var>x</var><sub>0</sub> is the positive solution to [equation&nbsp;(3.53)],
a polynomial equation in&nbsp;cos&nbsp;<var>x</var>.
</blockquote>
<p>
Since (3.53)&nbsp;is a generic equation, it ought to have <var>x</var> be generic,
rather than substituted with the particular value&nbsp;<var>x</var><sub>0</sub>.
Furthermore, keeping <var>x</var> generic is consistent with the treatment

<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> Omitting "on the" is stylistic, in the same way that one might say
"portions […] which lie this side of the inflection frontiers".
Having "on the" followed by "of the" is a bit of a mouthful.

Suggest remark about Mathematica not being able to

(Actual wording: it was a "checkmark" for boundary tracing.)
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="action">Not adopted.</span> This suggestion arose from a discussion about
how good the numerical method (using Mathematica) was,
and whether I could have done an extra example for a self-viewing case.
Now, Part&nbsp;I of the thesis applies boundary tracing to analytic solutions,
producing <em>exact</em> results (in that we reduce the problem
to integrating some ODEs, which can be done to any desired precision).
The numerical work is simply there to <em>verify</em> those results;
we are not pitting boundary tracing and numerics against each other.
Since the numerical work plays only a supporting role,
it should not be elevated by a comparison of what it can or cannot do
compared to the {boundary tracing + verify error} approach.

Evidently the range of rounding radii

boundary shape is the unknown.

we may obtain a family of height-rise profiles
as shown in Figure&nbsp;7.17.
<ins>The non-smoothness of the profiles

in the original (non-offset) wedge,
in the vicinity of each pseudo-rounding.</ins>
